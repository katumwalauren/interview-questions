Minify the combined CSS to reduce its size and improve load times.
// Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
Progressive enhancement is a development strategy that focuses on building a basic, functional version of a website that works for all users, regardless of their device
while 
Graceful degradation focuses on building a rich, fully-featured experience for modern browsers and then ensuring that, when viewed on older or 
less capable browsers, the website still works, even if some features are downgraded or missing.

// How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
6-8 resources
// What are the exceptions?
// Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time).
checking the current speed of a wed page -> this allows the tracking of my movements 
Never to scale down images -> this is done by using a larger image than needed which
         helps the lower the file size of the image
compressinga and ptimising content -> this is done by reducing many file into one file 
         and this helps the conent to be recieved as a small file

i would consist and adoubt tabs inorder to keepup with the uniformity
// Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
i would start with installing npm and react the go forward with css where i create the slide-show  
container where i hide the sliders in display:none. so i use fade that gives the smoothness

// Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.
Standards ensure that different products, systems, and services can work together seamlessly. 
  while 
  Standards bodies like the IEEE, W3C, ensuring that devices, software, and systems can integrate and communicate across platforms.
// What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?
Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) is a visual phenomenon where a web page displays unstyled or partially styled content 
          for a brief moment before the proper CSS styles are fully loaded and applied.
   how to avoid it is by minimizing and optimizing css files into one file to help the page run smoothly and faster

        are blind or visually impaired.


// Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.
props
Performance ->  CSS animations are often more performant because they are optimized by the browser's
       rendering engine
Declarative -> they are easier to understand an modify in terms of what is being animated.
Ease of Use -> Easy to implement using @keyframes or CSS transitions. They require fewer lines of code for simple animations.

cons 
Limited Control-> CSS animations offer less control over the animation sequence, timing, and events like pausing, starting, 
       or dynamically changing animations.
No Animation Logic-> CSS cannot handle complex logic 
Less Versatile-> Complex animations requiring fine-grained control 

// What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by browsers to control how web pages
 
 without CORS, a website hosted on example.com can't fetch data from api.example.net unless api.example.net explicitly
        allows it. This can create issues when a website needs to access resources like APIs, images, or fonts hosted on different domains.

// Describe the difference between SSR and CSR. Discuss the pros and cons.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
In SSR, the HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client (browser) as a fully-rendered page.

Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
In CSR, the initial HTML page is minimal, and JavaScript is responsible for rendering the content on the client-side.

// Are you familiar with static rendering?
Static Rendering involves generating the full HTML pages at build time rather than on each request. 

// Rehydration?
